        <h3>Hip Hop: A Culture of Vision and Voice</h3>
        <p>
          Hip hop is global, lapping on every shore and landing at every
          airport. But what does hip hop mean? Is it the music with a
          chest-thumping beat? The rapid-fire lyrics rapped into a handheld mic?
          Gravity-defying dance steps? Writers turning walls into canvases with
          larger-than-life letters and illustrations?
        </p>
        <p>
          The answer is all of the above—and more. Hip hop embraces these
          artistic elements, most definitely. But it also has blended and
          transcended them to become a means for seeing, celebrating,
          experiencing, understanding, confronting, and commenting on life and
          the world. Hip hop, in other words, is a way of living—a culture. The
          elements of hip hop came together in the Bronx borough of New York
          City. It was the early 1970s and times were tougher than usual for the
          poorer parts of urban America. From a whole lot of nothing—and a whole
          lot of imagination—hip hop took form. DJ Kool Herc is credited with
          throwing the switch at an August 1973 dance bash. He spun the same
          record on twin turntables, toggling between them to isolate and extend
          percussion breaks—the most danceable sections of a song. It was a
          technique that filled the floor with dancers who had spent days and
          weeks polishing their moves. The effect that night was electric, and
          soon other DJs in the Bronx were trying to outdo Herc. It was a code
          that has flowed through hip hop ever since: 1) Use skills and whatever
          resources are available to create something new and cool; 2) Emulate
          and imitate the genius of others but inject personal style until the
          freshness glows. Competition was, and remains, a prime motivator in
          the hip hop realm. Like a powerful star, this dance-party scene
          quickly drew other art forms into its orbit. A growing movement of
          hopeful poets, visual artists, and urban philosophers added their
          visions and voices by whatever means available. They got the word out
          about what was happening in their neighborhoods—neighborhoods much of
          mainstream, middle-class America was doing its best to ignore or run
          down. Hip hop kept coming, kept pushing, kept playing until that was
          no longer possible. Today, some hip hop scholars fold as many as six
          elements into hip hop culture. They include: DJing—the artistic
          handling of beats and music MCing, aka rapping—putting spoken-word
          poetry to a beat Breaking—hip hop’s dance form Writing—the painting of
          highly stylized graffiti Theater and literature—combining hip hop
          elements and themes in drama, poetry, and stories Knowledge of
          self—the moral, social, and spiritual principles that inform and
          inspire hip hop ways of being. From its work-with-what-you-got
          epicenter in the Bronx, hip hop has rolled outward to become a
          multibillion-dollar business. Its sounds, styles, and fashions are now
          in play around the world. DJs spin turntables in Sao Paulo, Brazil.
          MCs rap Arabic in the clubs of Qatar. B-boys and b-girls bust baby
          freezes in Finland. Graffiti rises on the Great Wall of China. Young
          poets slam poetry in D.C. So what is hip hop? All of the above and
          more—whatever we love enough to bring.Richard Colón was just 10 when
          his cousin took him to his first schoolyard bash in 1976. “Ah, I was
          just blown away,” he says in Jeff Chang’s history of hip hop, Can’t
          Stop Won’t Stop. “I just saw all these kids having fun...checking out
          the whole scene, and it was my first time watching the dance with the
          music being played...I just immediately became a part of it.” He soon
          became a big part of it. By his early teens, the boy now immortalized
          as “Crazy Legs” became a trendsetter for breaking—a dance revolution
          still popping, locking, and rocking the world. Making a B-line from
          the Bronx As hip hop culture rose from the streets of the Bronx,
          breaking spun up and stepped out from the concrete itself. Early
          b(reaker)-girls and b-boys like Crazy Legs and his Rock Steady Crew
          earned their skills on that hard ground, admiring each other’s cuts,
          bruises, and “battle scars” as they pushed one another to evermore
          audacious displays of style and guts. In keeping with hip hop’s ethic
          of improvisation, breaking is often a create-on-the-fly dance style.
          It mixes super-quick footwork with body-torquing twists. Robotic
          movements flow into smooth whole-body waves before dropping into
          acrobatic leg flares that suddenly halt in mid-spin freezes that seem
          to defy gravity. Breaking is the ultimate 3-D dance—flipping high,
          spinning low, and putting a premium on physical imagination and
          bravado. Getting on the Good Foot Breaking has copied from many dance
          styles to generate this uniqueness. These styles include the
          Charleston from 100 years ago that loaned its characteristic leg kick
          and arm swing as a top-rocking move. The ad-libbing of the Lindy Hop,
          popular from the 1920s on, also lives in breaking’s style. For
          individual inspiration, though, no one can best soul singer James
          Brown. His high-energy dance moves in the 1960s and 70s have inspired
          b-boys and b-girls ever since, and his song “Get on the Good Foot” is
          one of breaking’s early anthems. Tap, steppin’, ballet, disco, and
          modern all continue to contribute. Breaking has rummaged beyond the
          dance floor and stage to find many of its most dramatic moves. The
          whirling torsos and legs of gymnasts on the pommel horse are seen in
          leg flares, for example. Down-rocking reflects techniques from
          gymnastic floor routines.The world of hand-to-hand combat has also
          provided inspiration for b-boys and b-girls. Hip hop scholars often
          link breaking with capoeira, a martial arts dance with roots in Angola
          and Brazil that displays acrobatics, grace, and power. A full-blown
          showdown makes it clear why breaking contests are referred to as
          “battles” as dancers mix dance moves with shadow kicks, leg sweeps,
          and fake attacks in the faces of the competition. Breaking is much
          more than a sum of moves from various dances and disciplines, though.
          It is a living, breathing art form unique every time dancers take
          their turn in a cypher (see sidebar). Through the years the Rock
          Steady Crew, the Mighty Zulu Kings, the Lockers, the Electric
          Boogaloos, and thousands of other individuals and crews have
          continuously renewed and refreshed the style with original spins,
          fresh freezes, and new twists on power moves—often laced with
          body-bending humor. Competition and innovation in breaking—as with all
          things hip hop—is essential and inspired, and today its style inspires
          wherever people dance.

        immortalized as “Crazy Legs” became a trendsetter for breaking—a dance
        revolution still popping, locking, and rocking the world. Making a
        B-line from the Bronx As hip hop culture rose from the streets of the
        Bronx, breaking spun up and stepped out from the concrete itself. Early
        b(reaker)-girls and b-boys like Crazy Legs and his Rock Steady Crew
        earned their skills on that hard ground, admiring each other’s cuts,
        bruises, and “battle scars” as they pushed one another to evermore
        audacious displays of style and guts. In keeping with hip hop’s ethic of
        improvisation, breaking is often a create-on-the-fly dance style. It
        mixes super-quick footwork with body-torquing twists. Robotic movements
        flow into smooth whole-body waves before dropping into acrobatic leg
        flares that suddenly halt in mid-spin freezes that seem to defy gravity.
        Breaking is the ultimate 3-D dance—flipping high, spinning low, and
        putting a premium on physical imagination and bravado. Getting on the
        Good Foot Breaking has copied from many dance styles to generate this
        uniqueness. These styles include the Charleston from 100 years ago that
        loaned its characteristic leg kick and arm swing as a top-rocking move.
        The ad-libbing of the Lindy Hop, popular from the 1920s on, also lives
        in breaking’s style. For individual inspiration, though, no one can best
        soul singer James Brown. His high-energy dance moves in the 1960s and
        70s have inspired b-boys and b-girls ever since, and his song “Get on
        the Good Foot” is one of breaking’s early anthems. Tap, steppin’,
        ballet, disco, and modern all continue to contribute. Breaking has
        rummaged beyond the dance floor and stage to find many of its most
        dramatic moves. The whirling torsos and legs of gymnasts on the pommel
        horse are seen in leg flares, for example. Down-rocking reflects
        techniques from gymnastic floor routines.The world of hand-to-hand
        combat has also provided inspiration for b-boys and b-girls. Hip hop
        scholars often link breaking with capoeira, a martial arts dance with
        roots in Angola and Brazil that displays acrobatics, grace, and power. A
        full-blown showdown makes it clear why breaking contests are referred to
        as “battles” as dancers mix dance moves with shadow kicks, leg sweeps,
        and fake attacks in the faces of the competition. Breaking is much more
        than a sum of moves from various dances and disciplines, though. It is a
        living, breathing art form unique every time dancers take their turn in
        a cypher (see sidebar). Through the years the Rock Steady Crew, the
        Mighty Zulu Kings, the Lockers, the Electric Boogaloos, and thousands of
        other individuals and crews have continuously renewed and refreshed the
        style with original spins, fresh freezes, and new twists on power
        moves—often laced with body-bending humor. Competition and innovation in
        breaking—as with all things hip hop—is essential and inspired, and today
        its style inspires wherever people dance.
